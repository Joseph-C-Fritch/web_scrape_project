Blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies have gained popularity through social media platforms such as Reddit. This application attempts to visualize relationships between Reddit's r/Ripple sub-reddit and XRP price during the time period July 30th, 2018 and February 1, 2019.  The project attemps to answer the following questions:


1. Do the number of sub-reddit posts correlate with future price change? 

2. Does sub-reddit post sentiment have any correlation with future price change?

3. What are the most common words posted prior positive price change?

Pearson correlation is used to measure correlation and statistical significance is evaluated.

Data used for this visualization application were scraped using Selenium.  All scraping was performed on "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/" sub-reddit constrained to thread titles "Daily Ripple/XRP Discussion Thread ##/##/#### [Questions and Price Predictions]"

All associated files can and code are found in this file.
